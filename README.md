# NextBuildv8
 v8 of NextBuild  prerelease 21.05.23

This is the preliminary release - things will change, things will move, things will dissapear!

Major notes of this version is to build use F6, for traditional builds use Run With CSpect.

Modules are working, but the demos need fixing. There are lots of bits that I working through to fix.

There is also a bunch of junk that will be cleaned up as I go. 

Thanks

- Will now clean up cfg map bin files on launch
- Some of the copper audio examples are not working because they do not contain the original wav files
- Some CTC examples are not working correctly - to be fixed
